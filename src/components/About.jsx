        Hey, we’re Rich and Calum — two CSUN students with a drive to offer
        purpose. What started as us cleaning our own cars turned into a way to
        make ends meet. Over time, what began as a simple hustle became a
        passion we saw real vision in.

      <p className="px-8 text-lg text-left max-w-2xl mx-auto text-gray-700 mt-3">
        But we wouldn’t be here without our friends. They were the first to
        trust us with their cars, the first to spread the word, and even helped
        bring this site to life. Our growth was built on that support — proof
        that when your bros believe in you, anything can happen.
      </p>
      <p className="px-8 text-lg text-left max-w-2xl mx-auto text-gray-700 mt-3">
        We’re founded on passion, hard work, and most importantly, the
        overwhelming support from the people who had our backs since day one. We
        guarantee you’ll leave not just satisfied, but confident in trusting us
        for your next clean.
